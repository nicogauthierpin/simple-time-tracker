# Simple Time Tracker

I needed a simple time tracker for work and I figured since I always have a browser open, why not build it as a single HTML file that can be run locally.

Zero dependencies, not even images. Download the HTML file and run in from anywhere. Data is saved in local storage for persitence.

_Work perpetually in progress._
